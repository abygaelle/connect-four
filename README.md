### Motivation:
___
I decided to learn how to create the game Connect-Four because during my childhood with my friends and family we used to have game nights and Connect-Four was one of the many games that we played. I thought that having an online version will be great to share with my family and friends. Creating the game Connect-Four brings back great memories.
